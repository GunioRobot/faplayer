VLC-1.2.0-git is on the road!

Any questions please contact tewilove@gmail.com.

Requirements:
1. NDK-r5c
2. ruby-1.9.2

Notice for Cygwin users:
If you git clone the source in a Cygwin shell, build process should be fine.
If you download the archive, you have to overwrite the same named files from jni/ext/libass/libass to jni/ext/libass/include since they are symbol links.

Build steps:
1. Edit local.properties to fit your environment.
2. Run build.sh.

Application.mk file:
Currently you can only build the source with one ABI choice, armeabi or armeabi-v7a.
If you want to disable NEON version of ffmpeg, open jni/Application.mk and change APP_ABI to armeabi.
XOOM do NOT have NEON, so you should set vfpv3 instead of neon to -mfpu.

NDK issues:
Known not building on NDK-r5b and before unless LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES bug is fixed.
